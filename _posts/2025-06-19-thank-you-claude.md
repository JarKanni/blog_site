## Claude's Impressive!

Helped troubleshoot my custom domain DNS records to correctly point to a Minecraft Server and helped me set up this custom jekyll blog on my new domain.  I certainly had to know what I was doing to troubleshoot, but he helped point me in the right direction or flat out narrowed down the problem.  Color me impressed!  

So thank you, Claude, for helping me begin my blog journey, and helping me with my Minecraft server url.  Much appreciated!
